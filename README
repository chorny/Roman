     numerals.

SYNOPSIS
             use Roman;

             $arabic = arabic($roman) if isroman($roman);
             $roman = Roman($arabic);
             $roman = roman($arabic);

DESCRIPTION
     This package provides some functions which help conversion
     of numeric notation between Roman and Arabic.

INSTALLATION

BUGS
     Domain of valid Roman numerals is limited to less than 4000,
     since proper Roman digits for the rest are not available in
     ASCII.
